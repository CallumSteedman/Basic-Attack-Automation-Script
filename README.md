# Basic-Attack-Automation-Script
The Attack-Automation-Script will automate the process of discovering weak usernames and passwords being used for services running on a host. The script will read a file containing IP addresses, and for each IP address in the list the script will scan the chosen ports on that host. The script will then attempt to bruteforce the login if selected services are running such as Telnet, SSH and basic web servers found at port 80, 8080 and 8888.
